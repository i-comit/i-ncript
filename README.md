i-ncript is a USB based data encryption app built with Java. **No installation wizard** required, just drop the app in your USB drive and run. You will need Java SE 17 or higher however, but you can easy install that [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

Unlike other file managers like 7-zip which uses their own file manager GUI, i-ncript uses the native operating system file manager rather than create another window, making it similar to BitLocker without the restriction of working only on Windows.

It has a very **simple user interface**: A login page and a minimal dashboard. with tabs for logging output, a drag and drop box, and about page.

Implementing **multithreading**, it can encrypt and decrypt hundreds of files while preserving their attributes such as creation date, in under a few seconds using **AES**.

It has a unique encryption function called **Hot Filer**, which can keep watch of the encryption folder and detect any new unencrypted files that has been added and immediately encrypts them all within your native operating system file manager.
